Work Experience Program
========================

Basic project used to teach young adults how to develop web apps

Our aim is to provide all work experience students with an overview of the latest tech and best practices around coding to allow them a glimpse of what the development process is about, as well as showing some of the major concerns in development today.  To this end we will guide them through the implementation of a car insurance web application, with an added focus on security and user experience.  This will include the creation of a latest relevant tech UI which will be responsive to the userâ€™s needs (desktop, tablet & mobile) but which will also take in security concerns.  By encouraging them to write secure, clean code we can promote good standards and development to potential future developers.

Students Given:
- Basic template (to remove need to spend time styling the site in the beginning)
- JS navigation for basic functionality
- Instruction pack on what the process is going to be

Initial Setup:
- This will involve creating a Github repo so that can store and version their code so that they can keep a copy as well

    - HTML/CSS/JS editor (Sublime as non commercial?)
    - Any other tools as yet undiscovered
