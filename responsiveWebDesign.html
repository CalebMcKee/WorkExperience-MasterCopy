                    Responsive Web Design is something that's really started to gain considerable attention in the world of web over the past 2-3 years. It all started when a web designer, Ethan Marcotte wrote a famous <a class="link" href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design">article</a> which changed web page structure as we know it. The main thing you need to know about responsive web design is that it when implemented properly, it makes a website respond to its environment(eg. suitable on any device). This shift took time to gather traction but now in 2014, if businesses are wanting web sites created, they want them to be responsive.

                <h3 class="leadHeaders"><span class="mega-octicon octicon-chevron-right"></span>Why go responsive?</h3>
                <p>
                    Going responsive has it's own drawbacks but they are long-outweighed by the positives. The biggest issue in going responsive is time. The original approach to creating and positioning web sites was to use table-based layouts but this posed problems when users reduced their browser sizes or switched to smaller screens, forcing web sites to look strange and even content moving offscreen and out of view for the user. However, once developers/designers become more aware of a 'responsive first' approach, they can tailor web sites to respond to different screen dimensions much easier and with greater speed.

                <p>
                    We are now living in an era where information is made readily-available to users via the mobile web. People are no longer waiting until they can get to a desktop/laptop device to view websites, they're using their smartphones or tablet devices. This is where RWD really excels as it gives the user a tailored-approach depending on the device they are using. This ensures that they aren't missing any content and everything they are looking for is being presented on screen as the developer/designer intended. <a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/adactio">Jeremy Keith</a> once said "Stop thinking in pages. Start thinking in systems" - By tailoring websites per using RWD, we achieve this.

                <p>
                    Responsive Web Design is achieved by incorporating the following 3 things into practice when designing/developing websites.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-thumbs-up"></span>
                        CSS media queries
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-thumbs-up"></span>
                        Fluid media
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-thumbs-up"></span>
                        Grid-based layout
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>We will explain these in more detail below.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="lead">
                    <span class="mega-octicon octicon-file-code"></span>
                    <em>CSS media queries</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Media queries are at the heart of Responsive Web Design. Through the use of media queries we can target specific browser sizes and determine how to display web pages based on the result they return. Media Queries have been around for a long time but it's only recently that web designers and developers have started to truly understand their power. By using media queries we can make our CSS adapt to desktop, tablet and mobile layouts that will ensure the user doesn't miss any important content. Media queries are CSS properties and should be kept in CSS files when used on web pages. Below are examples of three different media queries. Each query targets a different browser size and depending on the size, limits the sizing of the element 'container'.
                </p>
                <pre>
/* Desktop sizing */
@media screen and (max-width: 1000px) {

    #container { width: 100%; }

}

/* Apple iPad sizing */
@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
    
    #container { width: 70%: }

}

/* Smaller tablet sizing */
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {

    #container { width: 50%; }

}
                </pre>
                <p class="lead">
                    <span class="mega-octicon octicon-file-code"></span>
                    <em>Fluid media</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In earlier times of the world wide web, it was normal for images to be set to a specific height and width in pixels but this always came with a caveat: If you minimized or maximized the web browser too much, then the images would begin to move out of place and leave web pages looking horrible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Responsive images are a big part of RWD. If your images aren't responsive, then everything's going to look out of proportion when users maximize/minimize the screen size. One of the best ways to work around this issue in modern times has been to place our images inside a &lt;div&gt; container and to set its max-width to 100% like in the example below: 
                </p>
                <pre>
img {

  max-width: 100%;

}
                </pre>
                <p>
                    This ensures that images cannot span any greater in size than the size of the &lt;div&gt; that contains them and means when users scale down from desktop screen sizes to mobile screen sizes that the images will scale down appropriately and still look correctly-positioned on the web page. If you don't believe us, click <a class="link" href="#">here</a> and re-size the browser to see the outcome :) It's also worth pointing out that this works well with embedded videos, too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is another way to resize images appropriately that requires writing media queries directly in-line inside the &lt;picture&gt; element. This is displayed below:
                </p>
                <pre>
<xmp>
<picture alt="description">
  <source src="small.jpg">
  <source src="medium.jpg" media="(min-width: 400px)">
  <source src="large.jpg" media="(min-width: 800px)">
</picture>
</xmp>
                </pre>
                <p class="lead">
                    <span class="mega-octicon octicon-file-code"></span>
                    <em>Grid-based layout</em>
                </p>
